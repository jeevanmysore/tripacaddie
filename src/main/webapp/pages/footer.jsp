This information is collected through use of cookies, log files, and third party sources.  Once we have gathered this information, we may use it to create a “profile” of your preferences, which we may “tie” to Your Information in order to improve your experience using the Website during future visits.

		<p><i>Partners with whom you have booked travel or purchased other golf-related goods or services.</i>  We share certain elements of Your Information with those of our Partners that are providing you with your golf trip or are providing you with golf-related goods or services. Such Partners may include: your resort or hotel destination; a tour operator; a golf instructor or seller of other golf-related goods or services; and/or a golf professional if he or she created a trip on your behalf.</p>
