<p>CONGRATULATIONS! Your Golf Trip named: Ooty trip was created successfully and you can now start planning by clicking here to <a href="${path}">View Your Trip</a>.</p>

<p>Since you created the trip, you will have special privileges to manage the content on your planning page including the responsibility of inviting others to your trip, managing the Pairings, Scoring and Strudel among other things. We know this is a big job, so we have made TripCaddie as fun and simple for you as possible so you can communicate all of the necessary trip details to your group easily. Don't worry, if you find that you need to delegate the Trip Leader authority to someone else, you can do that after you log in and access your trip.</p>
